* The main appeal of our application will be to see the astronomy photo of the day! 
* The fun twist on our application will not only be that you get to see a cool picture of something in space with all of its infomration displaying (real from NASA), but you will also find out which character from the hit show Rick and Morty is located in that specific location!
